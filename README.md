## How to run:
1. Download the html and Game.js files into your local device folder.
2. Run the terminal into your folder directory where the files are saved.
3. On your terminal run this command: http-server -c-1
4. Open the browser and go to: localhost:8080. then click on html file.
5. Enjoy !

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:
1. I would use more CSS animation effects to cheer up the winner.
2. I would double the number of buttons to 18 so that the game gets more challenging.
